# pingem
This is a minor side project that is intended to replace the bash_environment's
pingstats with something of greater visual bandwidth, as well as being 
decoupled from the platform. (pingstats only works in iTerm and triggers a bug
in iTerm that has existed for years and shows no signs of ever being fixed.)

The intent is to fire up pingem with a couple endpoints, and a ping will be
started to those endpoints. Statistics on rtt, like avg and a bunch of 
percentiles, as well as info about loss will be displayed and updated in real
time.

Further, I'm going to keep some track of how much time I spend on this. Not for
any better reason that I want to try to work on it in 1-hour blocks to avoid the
kind of insomnia binges that tend to come with such projects.
